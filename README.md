# MachineLearning_ExerPredict

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) project collected exercise data, focusing on the quality of exercise related to specific motion types.  A more detailed explanation of the data collection process and project overview can be found at the HAR website (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). Â 

We set to predict the "classe" variable, which assigns one of five letter grades to the exercise -  "A" (the best), B, C, D and "E" (the worst). This report outlines the process in building the model we use to predict "classe". 

This project develops and employs a random forest model in predicting quality rating of exercise repetition.
